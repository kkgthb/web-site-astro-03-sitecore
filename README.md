## Celebration

It works!  The phrase "`My Title`" was pulled from a real 3rd-party-hosted HTTP server's REST API endpoint _(although it was mock data, hence just saying "My Title")_.

## Notes to self

`tmc-config-generator.ts` renamed to indicate that the Sitecore-Astro folks authored that file, not Sitecore.

_("TMC" a playful reference one of the contributors being a "Bogdan" living in England -- see Richard Osman's comedic mystery novel series.)_
